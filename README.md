# Online Learning Management System

This is a simple PHP-based Learning Management System (LMS) that supports three user roles: **Student**, **Instructor**, and **Admin**. The system allows course creation, lesson and quiz management, student enrollment, quiz attempts, and course approval.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Authentication**: Session-based login, with user info also stored in `localStorage` for UI
- **Course Approval**: Instructors create courses (pending by default), admin must approve to publish
- **Enrollment**: Students are auto-enrolled when viewing a course
- **Lesson Progress**: Students mark lessons as complete; progress is tracked and shown
- **Quiz System**: Instructors add quizzes and questions; students can attempt each quiz once
- **Submissions**: Quiz scores are stored and visible to instructors
